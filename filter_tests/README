# Filter comparison

# in filter_tests.R and filter_tests2.R, U = c(373, 128, 32, 8, 2)
# compared to filter_tests.R, filter_tests2.R increases values such as Np, but removes girf and abfir, only retaining other filters.

# filter_tests3.R and filter_tests4.R use stew instead of bake to store the simulations
# in filter_tests3.R and filter_tests4.R, U = c(373, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2)

# the simulations in filter_tests4.R are all generated using respective U, rather than generating with the full model (U=373) and then taking a subset like in filter_tests1, 2, and 3.

# filter_tests5.R uses run_level=3 and includes girf and abfir
# the simulations in filter_tests5.R are generated using respective U

# filter_tests6.R uses girf_Ninter=5, abfir_Ninter=5

# in filter_tests1-6, li23() did not work correctly
# in filter_tests7, li23() is working correctly
