Residual analysis


code.R estimates various measures of anomaly for the fitted model
code-uc.R does similar, but for the unconstrained model (M5)

explore.R investigates the output of code.R
explore-uc.R does similar, for model M5

analysis.R is a more formal analysis of the output of code.R
analysis-c.R and analysis-uc.R are updated versions used to develop the
anomaly plot in si.Rnw
