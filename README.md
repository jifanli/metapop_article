# Metapop Article

This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the article: "Machine Learning for Mechanistic Models of Metapopulation Dynamics". 

The l-series and s-series experiments are designed as a sequential exploration where each experiment builds upon the findings of its predecessor. The newest experiments, l8 in the l-series and s5 in the s-series, encapsulates the most up-to-date findings.
